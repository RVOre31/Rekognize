# Image Emotion Classification Website ðŸŽ­
This project is a web-based platform that predicts emotions from images using a deep learning model. The application allows users to upload an image, and the model outputs the predicted emotion with a confidence score.

# Features

* User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean design for seamless image upload and result display.
Emotion Prediction: Classifies images into one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgusted, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays predicted emotion along with confidence percentage.
Responsive Design: Works across all devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

# Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Backend: Flask for server-side processing and integration with the model.
Deep Learning: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of facial emotions, built using TensorFlow/Keras.

# How It Works

Upload: Users upload an image through the interface.
Preprocessing: The image is resized and normalized for the model.
Prediction: The model predicts the emotion and outputs a confidence score.
Results: The prediction is displayed on the same page for user feedback.
Future Improvements

Batch Uploads: Support for multiple image uploads at once.
Explainable AI: Incorporation of tools like Grad-CAM for visualization.
Multi-Language Support: Expanding the platform's reach with language options.
